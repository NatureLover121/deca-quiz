    <h4>Which Event Category is For You?</h4>

    <p>There are two main categories of DECA events: Roleplays and Prepared Events. There are also two additional categories: Corporate Challenges, and Simulation Challenges. This quiz seeks to tell you which of the four (or multiple) may interest you the most.</p>
    <p id="important">However, if you have the time and the ambition, it is almost ALWAYS worth it to try multiple options! Personally, in my freshman year, I thought that I would be much better suited to a written event, but my partner wanted to try a roleplay event. We did both and we qualified for ICDC with only our roleplay. Even if you think that roleplays are not for you... if you have the time, I highly encourage you to try!</p>
